# Napoli

This package provides bindings to the [Node.js N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) so that you can build Node.js Addons in Swift. Our intended usecase is for packaging Swift code in an Electron app for use on macOS, Linux, and Windows(!!!), but this can work in other Node.js environments as well.

This project was originally a fork of [this LinusU repo](https://github.com/LinusU/swift-napi-bindings) but has changed significantally enough to warrant the creation of its own repo.

The next step is to create a sample project to show how to actually use Napoli with Electron.
